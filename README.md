## Features
...

## Planned Features
- [ ] Website to help you help the non-tech savvy

## Potential Features
- [ ] Formats

    - [ ] iOS, iPadOS, macOS (Swift)
    - [ ] Android app (Java/Kotlin)
- [ ] Platform for sharing guides with other users to ensure up-to-date guides and quick and easy access to help

## Why?
- **The obvious**:
    - Parents, grandparents, and other non-tech savvy friends are often confused by the technology they use, and it can be difficult to explain how to do something on a phone call, etc.
        - We've all been asked a few too many times how to do something that you've already explained a thousand times...
            - This creates tension and frustration for both parties, and can be avoided with a simple guide that can be accessed at any time and can be updated as needed (and can be shared with others). Maybe you don't have time, or simply don't want to be bothered; whatever the reason, you can just send them a link to the guide and they can follow it at their own pace.

- **The less obvious**:
    - Providing guides in a way that is easy to understand for non-tech savvy people is a great way for yourself *to learn how to explain things* 
        - to non-tech savvy people ([The Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/)) as well as everyone else
    - Providing up-to-date guides by quickly rewriting them as needed is a great way to 
        - *keep your knowledge fresh*
        - *learn new things* 
        - *practice explaining things*
        - *practice writing*
        - *practice using the technology you're explaining*
        - *understanding a technology as a concept / an abstraction rather than a tool*
    - Providing guides to improve accessibility to technology for people with disabilities
        - e.g. *visual*, *hearing*, *mobility*, *cognitive*
